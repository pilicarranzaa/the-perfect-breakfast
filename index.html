            <h3>CARBOHYDRATES</h3>
            <p>
              Since glucose from carbohydrates is the primary energy source
              throughout your system, most of your calories, or
              <strong>45 to 65 percent</strong>, need to come from this
              macronutrient.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >Ex: Wholemeal bread, fruit (banana, apple or orange) and
                nuts.</em
              >
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>PROTEINS</h3>
            <p>
              Protein is well-known for its role in adding to lean muscle mass,
              but protein also gives structure to all cells and provides energy
              when carbs and fat are not available. Your diet should consist of
              <strong>10 to 35 percent</strong> protein
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >Ex: Egg, chicken, ham, turkey, almonds, cheese, tuna, salmon
                and chickpea hummus.</em
              >
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>HEALTHY FATS:</h3>
            <p>
              Fat is a structural component of cells and blood vessels. You also
              need fat to absorb vitamins A, D, E and K, as well as to provide
              energy when your system runs out of glucose. Between to
              <strong>35 percent</strong> of your total calories should come
              from fat
            </p>
            <p><em>Ex: Olive oil, avocado, butter, egg, nuts and milk</em></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>FIBER:</h3>
            <p>
              Fiber is a carbohydrate; however, it does not provide calories or
              convert to glucose. You need fiber for bowel health and
              regularity. It helps push out waste and allows nutrients to absorb
              through intestinal walls.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >Ex: Nuts, fruit, whole wheat bread, lettuce and whole grains
                such as oatmeal.</em
              >
            </p>
